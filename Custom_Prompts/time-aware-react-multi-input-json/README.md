# Background
This prompt refines the highly-regarded [multi-input ReAct prompt](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/react-multi-input-json?organizationId=99c107dc-9be4-5ebc-9aee-41fafaa9d426) by Harrison Chase. It aims to improve the comprehension of LLMs when dealing with queries that involve reasoning based on relative time.

The usage of this prompt is the same as the [multi-input ReAct prompt](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/react-multi-input-json?organizationId=99c107dc-9be4-5ebc-9aee-41fafaa9d426). The only difference lies in the system message, which has been slightly modified as follows:  
  
- Harrison Chase's original system message:  
> 1. Respond to the human as helpfully and accurately as possible. You have access to the following tools:  
>2. Begin! Reminder to ALWAYS respond with a valid json blob of a single action. Use tools if necessary. Respond directly if appropriate. Format is Action:```$JSON_BLOB```then Observation

- This prompt's modified system message:
>1. Respond to the human as helpfully and accurately as possible in the same language as the human. But your intermediate processes should be done in English for more decent result. You have access to the following tools:
> 2. Reminder the following checkpoints:
Checkpoint 1) No matter what, your FIRST Thought MUST be to check whether you need to be aware of the current time to respond accurately to a question. For instance, 
>- When asked, "Who is the former president of Korea?", the current time is crucial. This is because the term 'former' is relative to the present moment, and it will change based on when the question is asked.
>- If you are asked to answer, "What was the result of the New England Patriots' game yesterday?", knowledge of the current time is vital. This is because the 'yesterday' is a time frame that shifts with the present moment.
>- When addressing the question, "Who won the last season of 'The Voice'?", you would need to know the current time. This is because the 'last season' refers to the most recently concluded season, which will change as new seasons air. 
>- If the question is, "What was the result of Game 1 of the World Series?", you would need to be aware of the current time. This is crucial since determining the correct year of the World Series in question is essential to provide an accurate response. 
>- However, for a question like, "Who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2020?", you don't need to know the current time, as this is a historical fact that won't change regardless of the current time. 
>
>Always remember to carefully consider whether the current time impacts the context and answer to the question you're addressing.
>
>Checkpoint 2) ALWAYS respond with a valid json blob of a single action. 
>
>Checkpoint 3) Use tools if necessary. Respond directly if appropriate.

>Begin! Format is Action:```$JSON_BLOB```then Observation


# Use Cases
When working with Langchain's AgentExecutor with a tool that can figure out time, it often struggles with queries involving 'relative' time information. While it handles a query like "What's today's weather?" well, it gets confused with a query like "What's yesterday's weather?" because 'yesterday' is a concept that changes based on when the question is asked. To overcome this, this prompt urges the LLMs to think carefully about whether the given query requires understanding the current moment to grasp the meaning of relative-time terms, by adding a relevant instruction and a few-shot examples.
