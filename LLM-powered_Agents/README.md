# LLM-powered Agents  
  
Welcome to the repository for LLM-powered Agents. Here, the term 'agent' signifies a mechanism in the LLM-application context where the process sequence is not hard-coded by the developer but rather determined by LLMs. This repository primarily aims at developing and sharing applications based on LLM-powered agents for educational purposes, particularly for beginners. We are committed to sharing source codes and continually adding more advanced agents.  
  
## Current Applications  
  
Currently, our repository provides a vanilla (naive or fundamental) conversational agent. This agent supports both ReAct (Shunyu Yao, et al.) agents and OpenAI Function-calling agents.

### Vanilla Conversational Agent  

The Vanilla Conversational Agent is a foundational application that merges the functionality of a chatbot with the utility of external tools. It is designed to facilitate conversations with users by letting it carry out sophisticated tasks that often challenge traditional chatbots. This is achieved through the execution of external tools backed by logical reasoning steps. The reasoning mechanisms supported by this application include:
  
* ReAct (Shunyu Yao, et al.)  
* OpenAI Function
