# LLM-powered-apps  
  
Welcome to the LLM-powered-apps repository. For the time being, this repository contains two main projects: **ReAct_Agents** and **Custom_Prompts**.  
  
## Projects  
  
### ReAct_Agents  
  
ReAct_Agents is a LangChain-based chatbot application, theoretically based on ReAct (For more details, check out [here](https://react-lm.github.io/)) and RAG (Retrieval augmented generation. You can find more about it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)).  
  
It supports various Language Models (LLMs) ranging from GPT to other open-source LLMs, and it provides a nice GUI interface for users. Recently, we added the support for [OpenAI Functions](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates).  
  
### Custom_Prompts  
  
Custom_Prompts is a repository of custom LangChain prompts which are prepared to be uploaded to [LangChain Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub?organizationId=60fd5f67-42b9-55d4-8b47-5ec7cae08093).
