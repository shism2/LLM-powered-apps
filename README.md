Welcome to the LLM-powered-apps repository. This repository contains two main projects: **ReAct_Agents** and **Custom_Prompts**.  
  
## Projects  
  
### ReAct_Agents  
  
ReAct_Agents is a LangChain-based chatbot application, theoretically based on the ReAct framework (For more details, check out [ReAct framework](https://react-lm.github.io/)) and RAG (Retrieval augmented generation. You can find more about it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)).  
  
It supports various Language Models (LLMs) ranging from GPT to other open-source LLMs, and it provides a nice GUI interface for users. Recently, we added the support of OpenAI Functions. You can find more about this [here](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates).  
  
### Custom_Prompts  
  
Custom_Prompts is a repository of custom LangChain prompts which are prepared to be uploaded to the LangChain Hub.
