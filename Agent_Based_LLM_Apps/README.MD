# Agent-based llm Applications  
  
Welcome to the repository for "Agent-based llm Applications". Here, the term 'agent' signifies a mechanism in the llm-application context where the process sequence is not hard-coded by the developer but rather determined by llms. This repository primarily aims at developing and sharing agent-based llm applications for educational purposes, particularly for beginners. We are committed to sharing source codes and continually adding more advanced agent-based applications.  
  
## Current Applications  
  
Currently, our repository provides a Vanilla (basic) conversational agent. This agent supports both ReAct (Shunyu Yao, et al.) agents and OpenAI Function agents. The llms used at the moment are GPT and llama. We aim to gradually expand the range of agent mechanisms and llms.  
  
### Vanilla Conversational Agent  
The Vanilla Conversational Agent is a basic chatbot that can make simple conversation with users. It supports the following llms:  
  
* ReAct (Shunyu Yao, et al.)  
* OpenAI Function   
  
We are in the process of expanding the range of supported llms and will announce updates as they become available.  
  
## Usage
